1.	LICENSE AND RESTRICTIONS

1.1.	License.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Company hereby 
grants to Licensee a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free copyright 
license to use, reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly 
perform, and distribute the source code, application programming interfaces, 
software development kits and related tools, documentation, data, technology, code, 
and materials that the Company makes available under this License (such items, 
including any modifications, enhancements or new versions that are made available 
by Company during the term of this License, the "Licensed Source Code"), in each 
case solely in connection with the Company's artificial intelligence-powered 
customer experience platform (the "Maven Platform"). For the avoidance of doubt, 
any access to or use of the Maven Platform is subject to a separate agreement. 

1.2.	Restrictions.  Licensee shall not (and shall not allow any other person to): 
(a) use the Licensed Source Code in violation of any applicable laws or 
regulations; (b) use the Licensed Source Code to develop any software or 
applications for any product, software or service other than the Maven Platform; 
(c) modify, distribute, or use the Licensed Source Code in a manner that would 
subject the Licensed Source Code to any open source software license terms; or (d) 
remove, modify or otherwise tamper with any notices or legends on or in the 
Licensed Source Code or any labeling on any physical media. This License does not 
grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product 
names of the Company.

1.3.	Ownership.  As between the Company and Licensee, the Company retains all 
right, title and interest in and to all intellectual property rights embodied in 
or pertaining to the Licensed Source Code. There are no implied licenses under 
this License, and any rights not expressly granted to Licensee hereunder are 
reserved by the Company. Licensee shall not take any action inconsistent with the 
Company's ownership of the Licensed Source Code.  

2.	TERM AND TERMINATION
	
2.1.	Term; Termination.  This License shall commence on the date that Licensee 
first accesses or uses the Licensed Source Code and shall continue until 
terminated in accordance with this Section 2.1. This License may be terminated by 
either party (a) upon written notice to the other party if the other party 
materially breaches any term of this License and fails to cure such breach within 
30 days of written notice or (b) for any reason upon written notice to the other 
party. Upon termination of this License, Licensee shall cease access to and use of 
the Licensed Source Code and destroy all local copies thereof in its possession or 
control. The provisions of Sections 1.2., 1.3, 2.1, 3 and 4 shall survive any 
termination of this License. 

3.	DISCLAIMER; INDEMNITY; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

3.1.	Disclaimer of Other Warranties.  Company is not obligated to provide any 
technical or other support for the Licensed Source Code. Unless required by 
applicable law, the Company provides the Licensed Source Code on an "AS IS" BASIS, 
WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, 
without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, 
MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible 
for determining the appropriateness of using the Licensed Source Code and assume 
any risks associated with your exercise of the permissions under this License. YOU 
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE NOT ENTERED INTO THIS AGREEMENT IN RELIANCE UPON ANY 
WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION EXCEPT THOSE SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH HEREIN.  
  
3.2.	Limitation of Liability.  In no event and under no legal theory, whether in 
tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable 
law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, 
shall the Company be liable to Licensee for any damages, including any direct, 
indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising 
as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Licensed 
Source Code (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work 
stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages 
or losses), even if the Company has been advised of the possibility of such 
damages.

4.	MISCELLANEOUS. 

Dispute Resolution; Governing Law. This License and any dispute arising under or 
in connection with this License shall be governed by the laws of the State of 
Delaware, without regard to its choice of law principles. Each party irrevocably 
and unconditionally submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts; 
provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek 
injunctive or other equitable relief at any time in courts of competent 
jurisdiction. 

Assignment. Licensee may not assign this License, or any of its rights or 
obligations hereunder, without the prior written consent of the Company and any 
assignment in violation of this provision shall be null and void from the 
beginning. The Company may freely assign this License, or any of its rights or 
obligations hereunder, without Licensee's prior written consent. Subject to the 
foregoing limitation on assignment, this License is binding upon and inures to the 
benefit of the successors and assigns of the respective parties hereto.  

No Agency Relationship. The relationship between the Company and Licensee shall 
not be construed as a joint venture, partnership or principal-agent relationship. 

Third Party Beneficiaries. This License is not intended and shall not be 
construed to create any rights or benefits upon any person not a party to this 
License.  

Entire Agreement. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the 
parties relating to the subject matter hereof. This License supersedes all prior 
understandings, negotiations and discussions, written or oral, of the parties 
relating to the transactions contemplated by this License.  

Modification. The Company may modify this License from time to time upon notice to 
Licensee. The modified License will be effective as of the time of posting, or 
such later date as may be specified in the applicable notice. Licensee's 
continued access to or use of the Licensed Source Code after the modifications 
have become effective will be deemed Licensee's acceptance of the modified 
License. If Licensee does not agree with such modifications, Licensee's sole 
option is to cease access to and use of the Licensed Source Code.  

Provisions Severable. If any provision of this License shall be or become wholly 
or partially invalid, illegal or unenforceable, such provision shall be enforced 
to the extent that it is legal and valid and the validity, legality, and 
enforceability of the remaining provisions shall in no way be affected or 
impaired.  

Waivers; Cumulative Remedies; Injunctive Relief. No failure or delay by a party 
to insist upon the strict performance of any term or condition under this License 
or to exercise any right or remedy available under this License at law or in 
equity, shall imply or otherwise constitute a waiver of such right or remedy, and 
no single or partial exercise of any right or remedy by any party will preclude 
exercise of any other right or remedy. All rights and remedies provided in this 
License are cumulative and not alternative; and are in addition to all other 
available remedies at law or in equity.
